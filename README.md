Healthy Lifestyle - Mediation App
Notes taken from team discussion:

Quick Start (Ankita)
10 minute meditation of randomly chosen songs and nature sounds.  The only screen that comes up from pushing this button is a screen that will to run for 10 minutes then a bell/chime will ring with 10 minutes is up.  We can all use this screen while our meditations are running.

Here are some nature sounds we can download: http://www.listeningearth.com/LE/general.php?pageID=8

Here are some free guided meditations we can download from UCLA

Emotions / How are you feeling (Jan)
Screen comes us with a TableViewController.  Each row is a different emotion.  Here are the emotions that we talked about: Angry, Stressed, Happy, Calm, Sad.  Choosing a row will bring up the meditation screen (possibly same as Quick Start screen).  It might be nice to run guided meditations (downloadable from UCLA).

Timed Meditation (Nodira)
On the timed meditation page, choose the length of the meditation.  5 minutes, 10 minutes, …  Once the time has been choosen, you get a meditation screen that plays music or nature sounds and alerts you when the meditation is finished.

Progress (Patricia)
Each time you do a meditation, you get points.   This progress page displays the number of meditations done in 1 month.  

Learn To Meditate ( Jan )
Information page that includes details on meditation.  Could include a simple guided “breathing” exercise.

App Information (Jan)
Page to be displayed when you first use the app.  This would also be available through the “i” (information) button at the top navigation.
